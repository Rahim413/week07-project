# Corner Shop Management System

This project is a simple **Corner Shop Management System** built with **React** for the frontend and **Node.js** with **Express** and **PostgreSQL** for the backend. The system includes user authentication, store item management, and the ability to search for items.

## Features

- **Login Page**: A basic authentication system for users.
  - **Login Details**: 
    - Username: `fo`
    - Password: `bar`
- **Dashboard**: A central dashboard with options to manage store items, search items, and placeholders for future features like sales reports and inventory management.
- **Store Items**: Add new items to the database, and display details such as price and stock quantity.
- **Search Items**: Search for stored items by barcode from the database.

## To-Do

- **Password Security**: Currently, passwords are stored in plain text, which is not secure. In the future, passwords should be stored using hashing techniques.
- **Relational Database**: As more features (like checkout or sales tracking) are added, additional relational tables will be needed to handle relationships between users and transactions.
- **Complete Sections**: Finalize all sections of the dashboard, particularly the **sales** and **checkout**.

## Project Motivation

I used this idea for my Week 7 project because this is one of the projects I want to create after I complete the course. So, I decided to start it now and will continue to develop it after the course.
